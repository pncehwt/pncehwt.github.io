          Message From The Trustees
        </h1>
        <p>
          As trustees of the PNCE H&amp;W Trust we are pleased to
          offer a comprehensive benefits program run by members of
          the American Council of Engineering Companies (ACEC) of
          Oregon and Washington on behalf of member employers and
          their employees.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is the PNCE Trust’s mission to provide competitive,
          quality and affordable healthcare choices to its
          membership and we have done so successfully since 1959. We
          do this by working closely with our healthcare partners to
          manage our program for long term success and when needed
          we have used our assets to reduce costs or to generate
          premium holidays.
        </p>
        <p>
          We understand that information is key when it is time to
          make choices about your benefits program. We encourage you
          to review our program options carefully and select the
          right coverage for your firm’s unique needs.
