        <p>Since 1959 it has been the PNCE Trust’s mission to provide
          <strong>comprehensive, quality healthcare</strong> at an <strong>affordable cost</strong> to our
          members, and while the healthcare system has changed over the past 60 years, our commitment to you has
          not.</p>
        <p>Over the past few years, we have seen the need to provide
          <strong>multiple access points for care, increased convenience, support</strong> for not just the body
          but also the mind, and <strong>someone to help</strong> navigate today’s complex healthcare world.</p>
