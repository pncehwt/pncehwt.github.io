        <h2>Firm PARTICIPATION GUIDELINES</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Your firm may choose the definition of eligibility based on working
              17.5 through 30 hours per week, applied uniformly to all employees. Your firm may also choose a
              uniform probation period before employees are eligible for coverage at first of the month following
              0, 30, or 60 days.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Partners, sole proprietors and owner employees are not eligible
              unless they are full-time employees.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Eligible dependents include spouses, domestic partners and qualified
              dependent child(ren) up to age 26.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Employees and dependents must enroll in the employee's offered
              benefits within 30 days of the employee’s initial enrollment opportunity. If the employee and/or
              their dependent does not enroll when the employee is initially eligible and does not have other
              coverage, they can only join the plan later during annual enrollment unless they should experience a
              qualifying life event (QLE) and submit their changes to the PNCE Trust within 30 days of their QLE.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Firms may elect 1 of 5 basic life/AD&amp;D benefit maximums without
              any evidence of insurability for all eligible employees at implementation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Firms may later choose to increase their basic life/AD&amp;D maximums
              at annual enrollment but will be required to submit evidence of insurability for all employees.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Firms that choose to add the optional LTD coverage at open enrollment
              will be subject to a 3/12 pre-existing conditions limitation.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Firms may adjust their overall benefits package annually during the
              PNCE Trust's annual enrollment.</p>
          </li>
