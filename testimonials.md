            <blockquote>"We were looking for a stable benefits and responsive provider when we found PNCE Trust
              shortly after we started our business. Joining the PNCE trust (managed by and for consulting
              engineering firms like ours) worked out wonderfully for us. PNCE stands out from the
              competition with responsive, locally based service and an extensive menu of health coverage
              options. Providing top-level employee benefits is a recruiting advantage and we’re confident
              that the benefits provided via PNCE have helped us meet our goals."</blockquote>

              consistently offered employee benefits that for several reasons are attractive to a small
              business like FME, Inc. PNCE’s staff (specifically Christine) has always been helpful,
              knowledgeable, and professional whenever we have needed answers and/or clarification on
              products and services they are offering and providing. Christine even took the time to
              help me out on the phone with a personal issue when I was in need and in the ER and couldn’t
              locate my plan credentials. We have appreciated PNCE’s support and friendly staff, and
              plan to continue with them for the foreseeable future."</blockquote>
