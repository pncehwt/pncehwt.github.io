            <blockquote>"PNCE and FME, Inc. have maintained a business relationship for many, many years. PNCE has
              consistently offered employee benefits that for several reasons are attractive to a small
              business like FME, Inc. PNCE’s staff (specifically Christine) has always been helpful,
              knowledgeable, and professional whenever we have needed answers and/or clarification on
              products and services they are offering and providing. Christine even took the time to
              help me out on the phone with a personal issue when I was in need and in the ER and couldn’t
              locate my plan credentials. We have appreciated PNCE’s support and friendly staff, and
              plan to continue with them for the foreseeable future."</blockquote>
